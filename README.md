# salt.flat() snaps

Welcome to Boliva's project: salt.flat() snaps.

After visiting the famous Salar de Uyuni and taking an abundance of classic perspective shots, I decided I wanted to bring the fun to those at home too.

salt.flat() snaps allows the user to choose a classic photo template and then opens their device's camera to capture their face. By mapping this onto the chosen template, a final, fun result is shown and can be shared around too.

While it's not perfect, this app hopefully brings a bit of Bolivian fun to those around the world - and maybe even some inspiration for a real visit in the future!
